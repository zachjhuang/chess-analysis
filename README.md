# chess-analysis
Final project for STAT 302 Data Visualization. This is an analysis of over 12000 games from 50 top chess players and grandmasters. It seeks to compare the [ELO](https://www.chess.com/terms/elo-rating-chess) and [average centipawn loss](https://lichess.org/faq#acpl) of different players across different events, results, dates, and ratings.

The app is available here:
